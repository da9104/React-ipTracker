# IP ADDRESS TRACKER

This app tracks the location of an IP address and renders details related to that domain like it's location, timezone, ISP. This app is built using [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) to render the map and all the data is fetched from [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/).
